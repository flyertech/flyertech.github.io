Some notes:

- We use [Unirest](http://unirest.io/) in our examples, but feel free to use **any framework or library capable of making HTTP POST requests**
- **Remember to customise the variables in the examples - the snippet will not work as-is**
- You have a personal API key in the Integrate section of your account. Copy that key and subsitute it in the snippet where `YOUR_API_KEY` is noted
- The HTTP requestâ€™s content type must be `application/json` _(the example should already take care of this)_
- The body of the HTTP request must contain **a JSON-encoded object with your data** _(the example should already take care of this)_
