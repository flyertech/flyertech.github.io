### What it is

This feature is useful to **integrate in your own platform the automatic import of generated leads** and manage subsequent marketing actions.

Leads are notified immedately when generated (when clicking on the offer if implicit opt-in is chosen, or after the privacy policy acceptance in the case of double opt-in)

### How does it work

The advertiser can configure an URL(*webhook URL*) for his/her e-shop; this URL will be notified of the lead's data to make the desired integrations on the platform (f.ex. insertion in mailing lists/newsletters, sending offer confirmation emails, other offers, etc.)

> If you choose to use webhooks, it's advisable to deactivate the confirmation and remainder emails in the campaign configuration, in order to avoid overlapping of too much communication to the customer.

### Technical implementation

A POST call will be made with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` coding (similar to a common HTML form submission) with the following parameters:

`ad_id`|campaign ID
`email`|email address
`coupon_code`|*(optional)* the user's coupon code, useful in case of multi-coupon campaigns
`first_name`|*(optional)*
`zip_code`|*(optional)*

For example: 

`ad_id=72&email=test%40transactionale.com&coupon_code=TRCOUPON&first_name=Jane&zip_code=12345`

The response content will not be considered. Any response status code >= 300 will be taken as error, so the system could try to resend the request.
